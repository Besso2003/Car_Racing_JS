## Game Idea
A fast-paced arcade game where the player controls a car moving left and right to avoid obstacles on a busy road. The game gradually increases in speed and difficulty over time, with more obstacles appearing as the player survives longer. Colliding with an obstacle immediately ends the game, requiring quick reflexes and focus from the player.  

## Game Objectives
- **Player Goal:** Avoid obstacles and survive as long as possible to achieve a high score.  
- **Win Condition:** There is no fixed win; the goal is to reach the highest possible score.  
- **Lose Condition:** The game ends immediately when the player’s car collides with an obstacle.  

## Planned Features

### Mandatory Features
- Player car movement (left/right) using keyboard controls  
- Randomly generated falling obstacles  
- Increasing speed over time to make the game harder  
- Increasing number of obstacles as time progresses
