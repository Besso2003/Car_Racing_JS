## Game Idea
Tic-Tac-Football is a two-player strategy game inspired by the classic Tic-Tac-Toe with a football-themed twist. Each row and column represents a football team, and players must place valid football players who have played for both teams.

## Game Objectives

### Player Goal
- Be the first player to align three cells in a row, column, or diagonal.

### Win Conditions
- A player wins by completing a straight line (row, column, or diagonal).

### Lose Conditions

### Draw Conditions
